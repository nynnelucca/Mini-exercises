MY TITLE: "675 BOXES NOT BOXES" 
MY WORK: https://nynnelucca.github.io/Mini-exercises/mini_ex7/empty-example/

OBJECTS: Using objects can not only make coding easier, but it can also make your code look more tightly(and pro!) set up. I have not used objects in my mini exercise, simply because I did not have time. I spend hours trying to get specific checkboxes checked. Also I had trouble seeing how to implement objects into my program. 

I had trouble finding an interesting approach to this exercise. As Alexei Shulgin mentions in the interview he does not find an interesting aesthetic aspect of this anymore, because it is not new anymore. 
In a way things such as the DOM elements/HTML element that we see everyday on website are too stylished today to make a new interesting output such as Shulgin did in 1997. Back then, the style of the elements was limited which makes it interesting to transfer them to a new context: art. 

But to return to object oriention it made a lot of sense looking at Winnie's code how it could be to big advantage to use it, and I will definetly use it in future code. 

Reading the article "The Birth of Object Orientation: the Simula Languages" I really got a new understand of how programming languages are born and how they borrow from each other. Much of the article was very technical and hard to grasp, but reading about the foundation of what we are using today is always important in order to avoid taking things for granted. 

From the DOM libary I have used checkboxes (675 to be precise), sliders and an input. As I mentioned I tried to set specific boxes to checked which unfortunately was impossible for me, but I do find it interesting that the user can use what I have made and make patterns with the checkboxes her/himself. The sliders are used to change the background.
