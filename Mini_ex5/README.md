• Give a title to your piece and describe your program with a screenshot.
"standing-reserve" 
• What kind of functions you have used from RiTa library? 
I had trouble with the RiTa libary and I could not get the functions I wanted to work. I also had a hard time figuring out how to use the different functions interestingly. 
I do not actually think that the functions I have used in relation to my text is strictly related to the RiTa libary.

• Can you describe your experience in working with found text as the source materials? 
It is an interesting experiment working with text in a digital context. As you can tell from my sketch, the use of text is quite limited. I tried working with more text but it bothered my eye, and I was not satisfied with it. I acknowledge the fact that my program does not have much to do with either RiTa or electronic literature. 
My initial idea thogh, was to show some of the data (in numbers) that is produced when you are online. Not necessarily online as in searching and looking at webpages, but in general (cf. Berry, "Real-Time Streams"). 
I would say that most of my life is simultaneously or only taking place online, and I'm pretty sure that applies to many peoples lives. Meaning that our lives initially becomes data (numbers, 0's and 1's), data which companies can profit from. This 'could' (probably already happened…) make us very fragile. 

"This turns life into quantifiable metrics that are now visible and amenable for computation and processing." (David M. Berry (2011)The Philosophy of Software - Code and Mediation in the Digital Age, s. 2) 

In my final work a connection to the above mentioned can be found. I did not wish to make some kind of intimidation telling people what they alredy know about the 'evil' companies gathering our lives as data.  I found a lot of inspiration (and the title of my piece) in the following quote:
 
"This transforms our everyday lives into data, a resource to be used by others, usually for profit, which Heidegger terms standing-reserve (Heidegger 1993a: 322)." (ibid.) 

But how do you capture life in a few lines of code…?
My way of doing this (and stay with me here) was by trying to make something very emotional. The song playing is the poem "My Heart's in the Highlands" by Robert Burns (1789) arranged for organ by Arvö Part. I think the sound of that says it all. 
I used a video of the sky to emphathize the thought about life. I think that together the sky, the sculpture of Aphrodite, the text and the sound ended up having quite a nice effect. It is 40 lines of code.  

• How might we think about the materiality of text/interface? How might we understand the “textual character” of the found text? (see the assigned class reading: https://elmcip.net/critical-writing/aesthetics-materiality-electronic-literature)
One of the main points of the text or at least main question was whether the medium was more present than the content in relation to electronic literature which definetly is interesting to consider. Here it is also taking into account that we are so used to the 'real' materiality of paper that we have trouble accepting the materiality of the digital, especially digital literature. 
Maybe we think of ourselves as more civilized/modernised than we are.  In order to fully understand what a given object is we (often) need to feel it in our hands and clearly see the relation between its physical shape and the content. When it comes to literature we see this connection when we hold a book. The purpose of the book is to be read. In some way it has a physical beginning (the front cover) and a physical end (the back cover). The tablet, the computer or the smartphone all have other purposes than just being there so we can read. Maybe the magic of reading is lost in the digital media's lack of commitment. 
But on the other hand, as the text also expresses, it must be recognized that electronic literature have a lot of different opportunities than an ordinary book.
