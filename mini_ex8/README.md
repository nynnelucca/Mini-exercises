My coding challenge: "Coding Challenge #2: Menger Sponge Fractal", https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG8ZK-rRkXo 

My flowchart: https://github.com/nynnelucca/Mini-exercises/blob/screenshots/flowchart.png

*What function/syntax have you added?
I have added several things: 

1. Line 47: If mouse is pressed more than 2 times it will not affect the sponge. This I did to prevent the program from crashing. Unfortunately I could not figure out how to get the sponge to go back to its original stage when clicking the third time. 

2. Line 15: I have loaded a song into the program.

3. Line 43+93: I have created a play/pause button. 

4. Line 71-76: I use the amplitude of the song to control the box(es) rotation on the Y-axis. 


*What is the difficulty of this week mini exercise?
The code that is used/written in Daniel Shiffman's coding challenges is a lot more complex than what I normally write. What I did was simply to copy paste the code from the challenge and then figure out the small parts of it afterwards. This is why I have so many comments in my sketch. I do think it is a good challenge to break down the code into smaller bits and really understand it. 
I did find it quite difficult making the flowchart. It was really hard figuring out the best way to organise it and what to write and how! I decided not to make it too detailed because I think that it would have made it more confusing than helpful. 

*How may we see, organize and communicate things differently by using a flow chart?
Flowcharts is a great tool to talk about code without having to sit and go through all the details in the code. It simply says: "This part does this, and if you press that this happens..." and so on. Our program is build on few lines of code, but it is easy to see how you can lose track in the process especielly if you are dealing with different files and if more people are involved. This is where the flowchart becomes helpful. You can jointly define where you are going and where you want to go, what your goals are and what have you achieved so far.
The flowchart might also help you to understand what you have made. I got a new understanding of my program after making the flowchart because I had to break it down. 
Of course it is also helpful if someone who writes code wants to explain a program/artwork/software etc. to someone who has no idea what code even is or does.
