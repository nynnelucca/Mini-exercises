I’ve made a Twitterbot! The bot posts a random sentence from my array (‘words’) every minute. On the screenshot or on my profile, you can see what it has done so far. I have followed Shiffman’s tutorial videos to figure it out, but I think I’ve gained a pretty good understanding of it by now. Partly due to the fact that I spent some time getting the Strava (a cycling app) API to work, but the instructions were few, so Twitter was a bit easier. 

Working with Twitter API means that you have to:
	- download and install Node 
	- get an access token from the dev.twitter.com site
	- use terminal to make the sketch work(on mac at least) 
	  meaning that I have to type ‘node bot.js’ in terminal to   	  activate my sketch. ‘bot.js’ is the name of my working file 	  (my sketch)
This means that all my tweets which you see on my twitter profile have been posted via terminal referring to my file ‘bot.js’.

I must admit that do not know how you will be able to run my code on your computer… So the following is a guide to how I think you might can get it to work: 

1.  Download node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/) 
    On mac you can check whether it is properly installed by simply typing ‘node’ into terminal. Then the ‘$’ will change to a         '>’. To return to the ‘$’ in terminal press ctrl c twice.
 
2.  In Terminal change direction ($ cd + path to folder) to the folder where you want to put my files 

3.  Type ‘npm install twit --save’ in Terminal

4.  Open my sketch named bot.js in your editor 

5.  Change direction to the folder where bot.js is saved

6.  Type ‘node bot.js’ in Terminal and go to my twitter profile https://twitter.com/nynne_lucca

My process: As I mentioned I spent a lot of time figuring the Strava API out, which means that I basically have gone through the steps three times. At first this bothered me, but then I realised that it is such a complex topic that you simply have to work through it three times or more just to understand it a little bit. 

My reflection on the aesthetics of (big) data:
I find this pretty interesting, but I do find it hard to properly reflect due the small amount we have read about this by now. I’m not sure I completely understand what aesthetics of big data even mean. In the text “The Politics of Big Data Aesthetics” the way of talking about data as a “data bubble” is criticised because, he argues, the way we talk about it about helps to conceptualise it. My understanding is that by visualising big data we can realize the aesthetics of big data which always is present but has to be brought to life in a way.
