• Give a title to your piece.
"About you"

• What are the rules that you have employed in your program?
I'm not quite sure what rule means exactly, but I am guessing that it has something to do with commands that result in the objects behaving in a particular way, like controlled randomness. In that case I can refer to my for loops. The first rule (line 27) makes sure that the program contains multiple particles which results in this web looking system. 
The second rule (line 34) controls the movement (direction) of the particles. The third rule (line 51) is among other things making sure that particles don't disappear when they reach the edges. 

• By using some of the concepts from the article - Generative Art Theory, can you discuss how is your program expressed the notion of generativity? (such as authorship/nonhuman creation/autonomous system/Complexity/Emergent behaviour etc)
My program expresses generativity by virtue of the rules I've made, so that it almost is behaving on its own, meaning that what it does is quite unexpected or unpredictable. And it is exactly this unpredictability that makes us wonder about "who is the author, me or the computer?". It is me (me watching Shiffmans videos…) that have written the code, but the result is in a way so distant from the lines in my editor. Executing the code brings new life to the computer itself and yet it is still completely and utterly dominated and controlled by me coding it. But when the system becomes autonomous, it is hard not to distance oneself from it, which actually is quite fascinating because by distaning yourself, you become able to observe it from a different perspective. You could say that generative art manifests the inteference between human and machine always present, but is especially showing when the system is visual surprising and satisfying.
