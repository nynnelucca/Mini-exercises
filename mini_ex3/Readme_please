//my throbber

Initially I wanted to show the underlying processes when loading a webpage, but I found it to be a bit boring and uninspiring. I wanted my throbber to say  something more, and I realized that the throbber in its nature is not only a symbol of a loading webpage, but a symbol of waiting. I read an article in Weekendavisen called "Det tavse k√∏n" (The silent sex) which was about the unbalance between how much men and women talk in public forums. Sadly, it turns out that men talk four times as much as women.

This is just a part of the inequality between men and women that we see in our (otherwise modern) society  today. I wanted my throbber to show its potential as a part of our culture which is why I replaced the normal 'loading information' with small remarks about the inequality. Furthermore, I added a 'counter' in the middle of the throbber to illustrate just how long it has taken (though it is not over yet) for women to become equal to men. I had some difficulty adding this timer/counter and ended up using the frameCount with a modulo sign to reset it, when it reaches 2017.
 	
The throbber is a speciel thing. It is like a reminder that something is being done, but it gives us no information about how long it is taking. I think think that is very similiar to the fight for equality. 
	
//programming and digital (visual) culture?
As we by now have read in many academic texts, design is never free from values and ideologies. I think that by learning to program we become able to see through the surface and unlock some of these hidden values in digital culture and by doing so we will be able to ask different questions and reflect in a different way about it, because our starting point is changing.
